'''
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, 
write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: 
"A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, 
and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 

Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

            if num >= length - ind:
                return length - ind
        return 0

        n = len(citations)
        citeCount = [0] * (n + 1)
        for c in citations:

                citeCount[n] += 1
            else:
                citeCount[c] += 1

        i = n - 1
        while i >= 0:
